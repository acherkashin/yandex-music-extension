## Requirements

To use this extension you should have Yandex Music account.

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

- `yandexMusic.rewindTime` - Rewind time (optional, by default is 15s)
- `yandexMusic.showElectronApp` - shows electron app, which is used for playing audio (for debug purpose, by default is `false`)

```json
{
    "yandexMusic.rewindTime": 15,
    "yandexMusic.showElectronApp": false,
}
```

### Remote Development using SSH

When working on a remote machine via SSH, the extension attempts to download and run Electron on the remote machine by default. This is not the correct behavior. We need to instruct Visual Studio Code that the extension should run locally. This can be achieved by using the [remote.extensionKind](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh#_advanced-forcing-an-extension-to-run-locally-remotely) setting as explained in the VS Code documentation.

```json
{
    "remote.extensionKind": {
        "acherkashin.yandex-music-extension": [ "ui" ]
    },
}
```

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Shift + Alt + P` - Play/pause track
- `Shift + Alt + N` - Play next track
- `Shift + Alt + B` - Play previous track
- `Shift + Alt + Y`, `Shift + Alt + M` - Open Yandex Music extension bar
